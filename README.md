Hello everyone, this is a screenmatch practice created with alura cursos,
is about to look up for movies information obtained from OMDb API, I suggest to run the class PrincipalConBusqueda and explore Titulo classes.
this sessions were about to learn from Records java classes, Interfaces, API conections, polimorphism, class hierarchy and some libraries.

Greetings.
